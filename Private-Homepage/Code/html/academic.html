                                                I took Computer Science in Computer Science Faculty. Thinking about the hardest
                                                of getting this title will make others boring. The happiest times I got in my 18th was
                                                to be accepted in Universitas Indonesia especially in Computer Science. 
                                                I found many fun things around me. People there was really kind and friendly.
                                                I can say this cause in my 4.5 years in Universitas Indonesia, I know that Computer Science 
                                                is the most suitable Faculty for me. Glad the God accepted my wish that time.</p>

                                                People said that the most happiest life is when you are in your high school. 
                                                But not for me. It was the hardest. I got difference kind of emotion changing just in several couples 
                                                of moments. It was really hard. Think that you are in teenage is make me think that I was a burden for 
                                                people around me. Thanks I am not a teenage anymore. 
                                                I was not popular back then but I am sure than almost a half of the school knew me back then. 
                                                I don't have any kind of gang, one best friend, and just getting along well with everybody. They like me because
                                                I could get along easily with any character.

                                                    It takes only 15 minutes from my home by public transport. Back then in Junior High School,
                                                    most of my friend was a boy. So many event actually happened that time. It takes a day to tell all of it.
                                                    I will take the best part. When I was in Bahasa Class, we studied about how to write invitation later, do MC, 
                                                    we held birthday party simulation. We even had a cake. After the class, my friend threw the cake to me and It 
                                                    really became a birthday party. I got home with cake all over my clothes. 
                                                    I told that my friend was mostly a boy. Yeah, Because of that I always help them to hide their money from 
                                                    bad gangs in my school that always took money from the weak one.

                                                In elementary school, All we do was playing. So many kinds of game that we played. 
                                                The most interesting one that I remember is we often getting fight with our friends. Maybe we just don't
                                                know how to lost on purpose for maintaining our friendship. No pressure, not so many target, not really thinking, 
                                                I think that three things that make it so different with other part of our school life. I really miss that time.</p>
